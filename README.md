# sample-machine-1
This is more or less my first more complete patch in Max/Msp.

There is a main channel which can be recorded into the other 3 channels on the patch. 
These channels can also have files read into them.
Each channel can have it's loop points controlled by it's respective waveform~ object.
Each channel is looped by a groove~, and it's pitch can be controlled.

I plan to add effects to this patch, and integrate it with a jitter patch I am working on.
